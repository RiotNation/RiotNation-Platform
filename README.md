# 🟡 Hey! Welcome to Riot Nation 🏴!!

We are a collective of passionate hackers and developers united by a shared vision:  
to **create, share, and promote free and open-source software** that empowers everyone — especially those left behind by capitalist tech.

At Riot Nation, we believe:
> 🔓 Knowledge should be free  
> 💻 Technology must serve people, not profit  
> 🤝 Solidarity > competition  
> 🛡️ Privacy is non-negotiable  

This repository is the **foundation of our movement** — a living hub for our mission, values, projects, and community.

No gatekeepers. No hierarchy. Just code, courage, and collaboration.

## 🌐 What We Do?

### ⚡️ Open Source Projects
We’re building decentralized, ethical tools that break barriers:
- 💰 **RiotBank** — Borderless, interest-free finance for the people
- ⏳ **RiotTime** — Skill & time exchange without money
- 📚 **RiotLibrary** — A free, uncensorable knowledge archive

All software we create is **open source, offline-first, and community-owned**.

### 🧠 Knowledge Sharing
We host workshops, write guides, and run tutorials on:
- Ethical hacking & cybersecurity  
- Encryption & anonymity (PGP, Tor, Signal)  
- Open-source development  
- Radical design & digital survival  

Because **education shouldn’t require permission**.

### 🤝 Mutual Aid & Support
We operate on **mutual aid**, not charity.
- Help with coding? Done.
- Need mental health resources? We share.
- Stuck on a project? The network has your back.

We grow together — or not at all.

### 🛠️ Ethical Hacking
We use our skills to:
- Expose oppressive systems  
- Build secure alternatives  
- Protect activists, journalists, and marginalized communities  

Our hacking is **defensive, liberatory, and principled**.

## 🧭 Our Values

| Value | In Practice |
|------|-------------|
| **Respect & Solidarity** | We uplift each other. No toxicity. No ego. |
| **Privacy & Anonymity** | We never dox. We encourage pseudonyms. We protect identities. |
| **Non-Hierarchical Structure** | No bosses. No CEOs. Decisions are collective. |
| **Inclusivity & Diversity** | All genders, races, classes, abilities, and backgrounds are welcome. We actively fight discrimination. |
| **Sustainability** | We build lightweight, energy-efficient tools. Tech should not destroy the planet. |

We don’t just preach these values — we **code them into our infrastructure**.
